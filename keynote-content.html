<h4>Title: Applying learning analytics to collaborative learning</h4>
<span>Abstract:</span>
<p>This study applies learning analytics to measure learners’ interaction, collabo-ration, and engagement during the process of collaborative learning in a MOOCs enabled course. The learning analytics provide instructors with visual-ized analysis of learners’ engagement for better understanding of learners’ col-laboration with co-learners and interaction with course context.  In addition, the learning analytics enable instructors to identify at-risk learners who have difficulties in collaboration and then trigger early intervention strategy. Our study shows that the learning analytics can successfully identify 85% of stu-dents who were at-risk in collaboration, and over 60% of the identified at-risk learners can improve their collaboration with early interventions. </p>
