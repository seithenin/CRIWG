<h2 class="title">Welcome to CRIWG2017!</h2>
<h3>Call For Papers</h3>

<p>We invite you to participate in the 23th International Conference on Collaboration and Technology (CRIWG 2017). The Conference is a major forum for academic researchers to exchange their experiences related to the development and use of collaboration technology, and it has a strong focus on technology design and development. Most published papers propose innovative technical + human + organizational approaches to expand collaboration support, often backed up by theory brought from various disciplines including computer science, management science, design science, cognitive sciences and social sciences. However, the Conference also seeks papers with theory, models, design principles, methodologies, and case studies that contribute to better understand the complex interrelations between collaboration and technology. Considering the heterogeneity of research in collaboration and technology, researchers may address the validation of their work through multiple approaches including laboratory experiments, fieldwork, analytic evaluations, case studies, prototyping, and empirical tests.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Accepted papers will be published by Springer as part of their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Electronic paper submissions are accepted in two categories: full papers and work in progress papers. Full papers have a length of up to 16 pages while work in progress papers have a maximum length of 8 pages, both of them following the Springer LNCS format (<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0" target="_blank">(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0)</a>). Both full and work-in-progress papers appear in the proceedings.</p>

<p>We use a double-blind reviewing process. Please do not include the authorâ€™s name and affiliation or any other type of information that may disclose the authors in the submitted paper itself. As a result of the reviewing process, the Program Committee may suggest changes in the format and/or the contents of the paper, including the category of the paper. In this case, a paper will be conditionally accepted. The Program Committee Chairs will decide on the final acceptance or rejection based on a second analysis of the revised paper.</p>

<p>Springer LNCS templates are available and should be used for submitted and camera ready papers: (<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0" target="_blank">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0</a>).</p>

<p>The papers should be submitted using the EasyChair system (the link will be announced soon).</p>

<h3>Journal Special Issue</h3>
<p> The authors of the best papers presented at the Conference will be invited to submit extended versions a journal special issue.</p>
