<h3>Paper Submission</h3>

<p>The Conference proceedings will be published by Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  There are two submission categories:</p>

<table border="0" width="400">
  <tr><td>Full papers:</td><td>16 pages maximum</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Work-in-progress papers:</td><td>8 pages maximum</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We use a double-blind reviewing process. Please, do not include the author's name and affiliation or any other type of information that may disclose the authors in the submitted paper itself. As a result of the reviewing process, the Program Committee may suggest changes in the format and/or the contents of the paper, including the category of the paper. In this case, a paper will be conditionally accepted. The Program Committee Chairs will decide on the final acceptance or rejection based on a second analysis of the revised paper.

<p>Authors should follow the instructions and apply Springer conference
